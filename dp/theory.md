Three common methods to apply dynammic-programming are:
1. Memoization
2. Tabulation
3. Recursion


----------------------------------------
        Dynammic Programming
----------------------------------------
    CanSum  ->  Decision Problem

    HowSum  ->  Combinatoric Problem

    BestSum ->  Optimization Problem   
-----------------------------------------

## Key Takeaways
    1. notice any overlapping subproblems
    2. decide what is trivially smallest input
    3. relate your base case with large input
    4. think recursively to use Memoization
    5. think iteratively to use Tabulation
    6. Slow down -> draw a strategy first!!!
